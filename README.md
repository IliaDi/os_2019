# os_2019 
Operating systems class at NTUA - ECE (spring 2019)
First: 
creation of a process tree (1 parent process F , and 5 child processes)
Second:
Parent process starts the child processes (which print something) using SIGNALS.
Third:
User gives as input 2 integers, the number of processes and the number whose factorial we need to calculate.
Processes perform multiplications one after the other and communicate through named pipes.
Fourth:
Processes with critical and non - critical sections, synchronization achieved using pipes to imitate semaphores.
